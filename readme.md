# Traffic Light Recognition using Convolutional Neural Network
An AI for detecting traffic lights from images.

The program starts from main.cpp.
All the Convolution neural network algorithms (including convolution layer, pooling layer, back propagation layer, ReLu layer, and reshape layer) are written natively, by Zhi, Siddhesh, and Derek.
